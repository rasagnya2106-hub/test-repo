# An API simulating a source of Fibonacci numbers with some noise.
#   For instance, poorly defined bumps on tree trunks, a hard to measure bunny population,
#   visual scan of arrangement of sunflower seeds, or any other system where you
#   know your values are fibonacci numbers, but some noise has been introduced in your measurement.

#   Noise scales by size of number to mimic that you're likely to be more
#   precise if you have a few to count, and off by more when there are large
#   numbers involved.
